    <div class="topic">Module 3: <br/>What's an article </div>
    <div class="head-description">Here we’ll get acquainted with articles as a type of writing and study them up and down!</div>
    <div class="start-head-moduleOne">An article is a written communication that portrays a central theme from a writer that they want to display to their readership. Article topics may vary and take showcase current or past events worldwide. Additionally, the writer intends on writing content that draws a human interest and connects with viewers uniquely in comparison to other stories.
        <ol>
        We usually write an article to:
        <li>Give advice and courses of actions</li>
        <li>Drive exposure on newsworthy and technological stories</li>
        <li>Influence the current opinions of the readers</li>
        </ol>
        <br/>
        Now, let’s look at this model article!

            <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 38px;">The thrill of the stage</div>
            <span id="underline">Introduction</span> <br/>
                <p>I’ll never forget the first day I stepped onto a real theatre stage. I knew immediately that this was my hobby for life! 
                I’m now a member of my local drama club. <br/> We put on two shows every year and have a lot of fun while doing so!</p>
            <span id="underline">A new beginning</span> <br/>
                <p>I first started acting by chance. A friend of mine was interested in joining a drama club, and I agreed to go along with her, to give her a bit of support. 
                And I loved it from the first day!</p>
            <span id="underline">Feel and convey</span> <br/>
                <p>First, drama is incredibly challenging. Not only do you have to learn what you’re going to say, but also understand the character you’re playing, 
                their role in the play, and then communicate that to the audience.</p>
            <span id="underline">Endless benefits</span> <br/>
                <p>Another thing I love about drama is how sociable it is. I’ve made so many good friends at the drama club, and spending time with them, 
                working towards a shared goal, is extremely rewarding. And in addition to all of this, what could beat the thrill of appearing under the lights, in front of a cheering crowd?</p>

                <div>This piece of writing may be considered as a model article, and here’s why:</div>

                <li>It has an interesting title:</li> 
                    <span id="blue-text">The thrill of the stage</span>

                <li>It has a first sentence which interests the reader and encourages them to read more:</li> 
                <span id="blue-text">I’ll never forget the first day I stepped onto a real theatre stage.</span>

                <li>It is organised into clear paragraphs, each with a topic sentence:</li> 
                <span id="blue-text">I first started acting by chance. A friend of mine...</span>

                <li>It gives the writer’s opinions:</li> 
                <span id="blue-text">And I loved it from the first day!</span>

                <li>It uses creative language with strong meanings:</li> 
                <span id="blue-text">...incredibly challenging</span>

                <li>It gives examples to support the ideas:</li> 
                <span id="blue-text">Not only do you have to learn..., but also understand...</span>

                <li>It uses structures to add emphasis:</li> 
                <span id="blue-text">Another thing I love about drama is how sociable it is.</span>

                <li>It ends with a question (or you can choose a lively final sentence):</li> 
                <span id="blue-text">...what could beat the thrill of appearing under the lights, in front of a cheering crowd?</span>
            </ol>
            <ol>
           <div>To create a great article, remember:</div>
            <li>to include all the suggested ideas from the task</li>
            <li>to choose an interesting title for your article</li>
            <li>to organise the ideas into clear paragraphs, each focusing on one topic</li>
            <li>to make the reader feel interested (for example, by asking them questions)</li>
            <li>to use a wide range of creative language and language structures (see <br/>Modules 1&2)</li>
            <li>to include your own opinion and experiences.</li>
