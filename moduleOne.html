        Now let’s get acquainted with the topic of <span id="bold">Parallel constructions</span>!
        <div>
            Parallel ideas must be presented in parallel grammatical form, which means that each part of a sentence uses the same grammatical structure.
            For sure you’ve already faced parallel constructions, for example:
        </div>
        <div class="moduleOne-rules">
            <div>
            both + and:<br/>
            <span id="rules-basic">The films were enjoyable both <span id="underline">to watch</span> and <span id="underline">to discuss</span>.</span><br/>
            <span id="rules-red">The films were enjoyable both <span id="underline">to watch </span>and <span id="underline">for discussing</span>.</span>
            </div>
            
            <div>
            (n)either + (n)or:<br/>
            <span id="rules-basic">Neither <span id="underline">the responses to the questionnaire</span> nor <span id="underline">the responses to the survey were answered</span>.</span><br/>
            <span id="rules-red">Neither <span id="underline">the responses to the questionnaire</span> nor <span id="underline">what we asked on the survey were answered</span>.</span>
            </div>

            <div>
            not only + but also:<br/>
            <span id="rules-basic">It was surprising not only <span id="underline">that the house sold</span> but <span id="underline">also that it sold well over the asking price</span>.</span><br/>
            <span id="rules-red">It was surprising not only <span id="underline">that the house sold</span>, but <span id="underline">also it sold well over the asking price</span>.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            Look at the <span style="color:#DE3A08;">sentences in red</span>. They are <span style="font-weight: 500;">incorrect</span>, however, they are often used by inattentive students. So don’t be one - use parallel constructions!
            <br/>I have underlines the parallel parts for you to see the difference easier.
        </div>
        <div>
            A wise idea would be to use parallel constructions whenever you use lists in an article. <span style="font-weight: 500;">Sentences with lists</span> require particular attention to parallel construction:
        </div>

        <div class="circle-text-black"><span style="color: #DE3A08;">This paper will address <span id="underline">No Child Left Behind</span>, <span id="underline">how to teach effectively</span>, and <span id="underline">instructing with multimedia aids</span>. </span></div>
        <div>
            Here all the elements that are supposed to be parallel constitute different parts of speech and play different roles in the sentence. We have to fix this by making a parallel construction:
        </div>
        <div class="circle-text-black">
            This paper will address <span id="underline">No Child Left Behind benchmarks</span>, <span id="underline">effective teaching strategies</span>, and <span id="underline">multimedia instructional aids.</span>
        </div>
        <div>
            Now, the list has correct <span id="bold">parallel elements</span> that are all <span id="bold">plural nouns</span> benchmarks, strategies, and aids.
        </div>
        <div class="circle-text-black">
            <span style="color: #DE3A08;">The students were <span id="underline">unprepared</span>, <span id="underline">poorly behaved</span>, and <span id="underline">disrupted the class</span>.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="circle-text-black">
            The students were <span id="underline">underprepared</span>, <span id="underline">poorly behaved</span>, and <span id="underline">disruptive</span>.
        </div>
        <div>
            Now, the list has correct <span id="bold">parallel elements</span> that are all <span id="bold">adjectives:</span> underprepared, behaved, and disruptive.
        </div>
        <div>
            Seems easy enough, right? So let’s do some training exercises on grammar and then move on to other modules!
